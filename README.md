Chase'Em was created by student Yettsy Knapp in GA SEI 6 DEN in Dec 2019.
 Chase'Em is a two player game that allows users to utlize four components to reach a high score against eachother.
 -Users will be located at the bottom of the platform(grid) rectangle div.
 -User will know when it's their turn by the red and blue user light bubble.
 -User will use left and right arrow to move their platform to the fit under the bubble they want to target.
 -User will use 'f' button to fire to their target.
 There is timer that will count down at 10 seconds for each user to aim, shoot, and successfully execute target located at     the top of the platform. Stretch Goal: increasing time for each user to 25 seconds instead of 10 seconds.
